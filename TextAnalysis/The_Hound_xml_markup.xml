      “Of the origin of the <concept definition="Legend of the Hound">Hound of the Baskervilles</concept>,
      I, from Hugo Baskerville, write this. Hugo was wild, stole a girl, she escaped.
      He chased her with hounds across the moor. A shepherd saw Hugo with a hound of hell.
      They found Hugo dead with a huge beast over him. The hound has plagued us since.”
